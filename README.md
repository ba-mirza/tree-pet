# ATTENTION
## Not ready
In the process...

The project is not ready yet. I am still stydying.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
